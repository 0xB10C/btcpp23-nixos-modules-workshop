# NixOS Modules workshop for [bitcoin++ 23]

This workshop makes use of [GitHub Codespaces] to spin up a personal enviroment
for you to work in. GitHub currently offers 120h of free CPU time per month
for Codespaces. All you need is a GitHub account.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/0xB10C/btcpp23-nixos-modules-workshop?quickstart=1)

This will open a new tab with a VSCode interface. The codespace automatically
starts a NixOS virtual machine. This might take a couple of minutes. It will let
you know when the VM is ready.

Workshop instructions and slides can be found on [b10c.me/bpp23].
